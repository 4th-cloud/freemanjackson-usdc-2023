# findSearchTermInBooks

## Welcome Message

Hello, I'm Freeman Jackson, and this is my project repository for the U.S. Digital Corps software engineering role application. The `findSearchTermInBooks` project showcases my JavaScript development skills and problem-solving abilities.

## Repository Overview

In this repository, you'll find several key components that I have prepared:

1. **README.md**: That's this document! It's here to guide you through what I've created and how everything works.
2. **tester.html**: This HTML file is vital for testing the JavaScript code I've developed. It's designed for simplicity and ease of use.
3. **book_search.js**: The core of my assessment. I've developed a function here called `findSearchTermInBooks`, aimed at searching for terms within book phrases.

## My Development Process

### Setting Up

- I cloned this repository to my local machine, making it easier to access and test.
- I've been using modern web browsers like Firefox and Chrome for testing and debugging.

### Function Implementation

- I focused my efforts on `book_search.js`, aiming to create an efficient and clean function for searching text.
- The key was to write code that not only works but is also easy to read and maintain.

### Testing the Code

- To test my code, I simply opened `tester.html` in a browser.
- Watching the code run and the results pop up in the web developer console was crucial for debugging.
- I frequently used the developer tools in both [Firefox](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/browser_console/index.html) and [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/) for fine-tuning.

### Crafting Tests

- I included several unit tests in `book_search.js` to ensure everything worked as expected.
- These tests covered a range of scenarios, from straightforward cases to more complex edge cases.

## Submission

- After completing the project, I committed my work to a new repository: `freemanjackson-usdc-2023`.
- This name represents my personal journey in civic tech and the unique contributions I hope to make.

## Additional Notes

- I've referred to various resources for JavaScript and testing strategies, ensuring that I'm following best practices.
- This project was not just an assessment; it was a chance for me to grow as a developer and showcase my skills.

## Parting Thoughts

This project has been a significant step in my journey as a software engineer. I approached it with a blend of creativity and precision, aiming to deliver quality work. It's an opportunity to make my mark in the field of civic technology, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.
