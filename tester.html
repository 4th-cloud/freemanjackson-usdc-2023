    <h1>Freeman Jackson Code Tester</h1>
    <p>
      This HTML file is meticulously crafted to test the JavaScript function I developed for searching terms in books.
    </p>
    <p>
      The design of this file mirrors the kind of thorough testing environment I anticipate my reviewers will use. It's essential for ensuring that my code not only works but excels in performance and reliability.
    </p>
    <p>
      My usage strategy for this file is methodical and iterative:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Opening this file in a browser kicks off my testing cycle.</li>
      <li>I then dive into the web developer console, where I can observe the results of my tests in real-time.</li>
      <li>Using my preferred code editor, I iterate on my solution, refining and improving with each cycle.</li>
      <li>Each save and refresh of the browser window is an opportunity to see the impact of my changes and to ensure everything is functioning as intended.</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Scripts for executing my tests -->
    <script>
      positiveTest();
      negativeTest();
      caseSensitiveTest();
